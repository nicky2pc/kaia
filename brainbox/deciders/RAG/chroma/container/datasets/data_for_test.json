They were\nthe last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or\nmysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.\nMr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which\nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he\ndid have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and\nhad nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful\nas she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on\nthe neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a\nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.\nThey didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the\nPotters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for\nseveral years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister,\nbecause her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as\nunDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think\nwhat the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\nDursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never\neven seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the\nPotters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\nWhen Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday\nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to\nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all\nover the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring\ntie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\nNone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.\nAt half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked\nMrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed,\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at\nthe walls. ‘Little tyke,’ chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got\ninto his car and backed out of number four’s drive.\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley\ndidn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head around to look\nagain. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but\nthere wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It\nmust have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the\ncat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the\nroad, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that\nsaid Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or\nsigns. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his\nmind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a large\norder of drills he was hoping to get that day.\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by\nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t\nhelp noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed\nin funny clothes – the get-ups you saw on young people! He supposed\nthis was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the\nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing\nquite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley\nwas enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!\nThe nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably\nsome silly stunt – these people were obviously collecting for something\n… yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later,\nMr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.\nMr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office\non the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping\npast in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they\npointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most\nof them had never seen an owl even at night-time. Mr Dursley,\nhowever, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted\na bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunch-time, when he\nthought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a\nbun from the baker’s opposite.\nHe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a\ngroup of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed.\nHe didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This lot were\nwhispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It\nwas on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag,\nthat he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n‘The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’\n‘– yes, their son, Harry –’\nMr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at\nthe whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought\nbetter of it.\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,\nsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone and had\nalmost finished dialling his home number when he changed his mind.\nHe put the receiver back down and stroked his moustache, thinking …\nno, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was\nsure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.\nCome to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry.\nHe’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold.\nThere was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley, she always got so upset at\nany mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like\nthat … but all the same, those people in cloaks …\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon,\nand when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried\nthat he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised that the man was\nwearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost\nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile\nand he said in a squeaky voice that made passers-by stare: ‘Don’t be\nsorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for\nYou-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be\ncelebrating, this happy, happy day!’\nAnd the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and\nwalked off.\nMr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a\ncomplete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle,\nwhatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off\nhome, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped\nbefore, because he didn’t approve of imagination.\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he\nsaw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby cat he’d spotted\nthat morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was\nthe same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this\nnormal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself\ntogether, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to\nmention anything to his wife.\nMrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over\ndinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how\nDudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley tried to act\nnormally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the\nliving-room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n‘And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the\nnation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls\nnormally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have\nbeen hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\nsunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\nchanged their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself a grin.\n‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?’\n‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that, but\nit’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far\napart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me\nthat instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of\nshooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night\nearly – it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night\ntonight.’\nMr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over\nBritain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over\nthe place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters …\nMrs Dursley came into the living-room carrying two cups of tea.\nIt was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat\nnervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t heard from your sister\nlately, have you?’\nAs he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry.\nAfter all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\n‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’\n‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls …\nshooting stars … and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town\ntoday …’\n‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.\n‘Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do with\n… you know … her lot.’\nMrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley\nwondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name ‘Potter’. He\ndecided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ‘Their\nson – he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?’\n‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffly.\n‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’\n‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’\n‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes, I\nquite agree.’\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs\nto bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat\nwas still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it was\nwaiting for something.\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do\nwith the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were related to a pair\nof – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but\nMr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last,\ncomforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters\nwere involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs\nDursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\nthem and their kind … He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get\nmixed up in anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned\nover. It couldn’t affect them …\nHow very wrong he was.\nMr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but\nthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was\nsitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed in\nthe next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was\nnearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,\nappeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped\nout of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\nNothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. He\nwas tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard,\nwhich were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long\nrobes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and high-heeled, buckled\nboots. His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon\nspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had\nbeen broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just arrived\nin a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.\nHe was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did\nseem to realise he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.\nFor some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled\nand muttered, ‘I should have known.’\nHe had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It\nseemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in\nthe air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.\nHe clicked it again – the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve\ntimes he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left in the whole\nstreet were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of\nthe cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even\nbeady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was\nhappening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer\nback inside his cloak and set off down the street towards number four,\nwhere he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but\nafter a moment he spoke to it.\n‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was\nsmiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square\nglasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its\neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was\ndrawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.\n‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.’\n‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’ said\nProfessor McGonagall.\n‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have\npassed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently.\n‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no – even the Muggles\nhave noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.’ She jerked\nher head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. ‘I heard it.\nFlocks of owls … shooting stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid.\nThey were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent –\nI’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense. ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve had\nprecious little to celebrate for eleven years.’\n‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But that’s\nno reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on\nthe streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\nswapping rumours.’\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as\nthough hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she\nwent on: ‘A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who\nseems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I\nsuppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?’\n‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to be\nthankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’\n‘A what?’\n‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather\nfond of.’\n‘No, thank you,’ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though\nshe didn’t think this was the moment for sherbet lemons. ‘As I say,\neven if You-Know-Who has gone –’\n‘My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can\ncall him by his name? All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for eleven\nyears I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper\nname: Voldemort.’ Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore,\nwho was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It all\ngets so confusing if we keep saying “You-Know-Who”.’ I have never\nseen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.’\n‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding\nhalf-exasperated, half-admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows\nyou’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right, Voldemort – was\nfrightened of.’\n‘You flatter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had\npowers I will never have.’\n‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’\n‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam\nPomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’ Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and\nsaid, ‘The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around. You\nknow what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About\nwhat finally stopped him?’\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she\nwas most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a\ncold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed\nDumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that\nwhatever ‘everyone’ was saying, she was not going to believe it until\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing\nanother sherbet lemon and did not answer.\n‘What they’re saying,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night\nVoldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters.\nThe rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are – that they’re –\ndead.’\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n‘Lily and James … I can’t believe it … I didn’t want to believe\nit … Oh, Albus …’\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I know\n… I know …’ he said heavily.\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. ‘That’s\nnot all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry. But – he\ncouldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,\nbut they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s\npower somehow broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n‘It’s – it’s true?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s\ndone … all the people he’s killed … he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s\njust astounding … of all the things to stop him … but how in the name\nof heaven did Harry survive?’\n‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never know.’\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and\ndabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great\nsniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was\na very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to\nDumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,\n‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the\nway?’\n‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose you’re\ngoing to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’\n‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the\nonly family he has left now.’\n‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?’\ncried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at\nnumber four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching them all\nday. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got\nthis son – I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street,\nscreaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!’\n‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore firmly. ‘His aunt\nand uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older.\nI’ve written them a letter.’\n‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back\ndown on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all\nthis in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be\nfamous – a legend – I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as\nHarry Potter Day in future – there will be books written about Harry –\nevery child in our world will know his name!’\n‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top\nof his half-moon glasses. ‘It would be enough to turn any boy’s head.\nFamous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t\neven remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing\nup away from all that until he’s ready to take it?’\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,\nswallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of course. But how is\nthe boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She eyed his cloak suddenly as\nthough she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’\n‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as\nimportant as this?’ ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.\n‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said Professor\nMcGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He\ndoes tend to – what was that?’\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It\ngrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some\nsign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky\n– and a huge motorbike fell out of the air and landed on the road in\nfront of them.\nIf the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting\nastride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five\ntimes as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild –\nlong tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had\nhands the size of dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like\nbaby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of\nblankets.\n‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And\nwhere did you get that motorbike?’\n‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant,\nclimbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius Black\nlent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’\n‘No problems, were there?’\n‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was\nflyin’ over Bristol.’\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the\nbundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.\nUnder a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a\ncuriously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n‘Is that where –?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.\n‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He’ll have that scar for ever.’\n‘Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?’\n‘Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in useful. I have\none myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the London\nUnderground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d better get this over with.’\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the\nDursleys’ house.\n‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.\nHe bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what\nmust have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid\nlet out a howl like a wounded dog.\n‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the\nMuggles!’\n‘S-s-sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted\nhandkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c-c-can’t stand it – Lily\nan’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles –’\n‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\nwe’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid\ngingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall\nand walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took\na letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets and then came\nback to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and\nlooked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor\nMcGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone\nfrom Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n‘Well,’ said Dumbledore finally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no business\nstaying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.’\n‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffled voice. ‘I’d best get this\nbike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor Dumbledore,\nsir.’\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung\nhimself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into life; with a roar\nit rose into the air and off into the night.\n‘I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,’ said\nDumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in\nreply.\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the\ncorner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once\nand twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat\nslinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just\nsee the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel and\nwith a swish of his cloak he was gone.\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay\nsilent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside\nhim and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was\nfamous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs\nDursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\nbottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\npinched by his cousin Dudley … He couldn’t know that at this very\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices: ‘To Harry Potter – the boy\nwho lived!’"

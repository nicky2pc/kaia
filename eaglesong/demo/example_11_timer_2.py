### Advanced timer's handling

Such handling of the timer's signals brings the problem for the multi-step skills that expect
a certain input (such as menu). Obviously, they are going to be ruined by TimerTicks coming unexpectedly.

To avoid this, Timer signals have to be filtered out of normal flow. Here is the full code of how to do this.
At some point there will be some abstractions to make this in the easier way,
but at this point, let's see how it works under the hood. If you want to somehow manipulate with
input or outputs of skill A inside the skill B, you must isolate A inside the Automaton.
Automaton is an entity that translates these chatflows with all the `yield` into a normal function that
consumes one input and produces one output.

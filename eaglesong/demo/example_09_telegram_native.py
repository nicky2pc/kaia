## Writing Telegram-native skills

`eaglesong` allows you to write the skills for Telegram only,
without using TelegramTranslationFilter.

In this case, `TgContext` will be your context (containing Telegram primitives
of the input), and the output will be TgCommand. To create TgCommand with
hints from IDE, use TgCommand.mock().

This is fine approach, if you really want to create a Telegram skill (e.g. one managing Telegram group).
But if you program a generic skill, it is better not to use this approach, as it's better to keep the skill
compatible with other media (such as voice assistant). Also, Telegram skills are a bit more cumbersome to
write and to test.

## Authorization: combining chat flows

This section demonstrates how to achieve code reusability across different chatflow

### No reusability: copy and paste!

Authorization is very important step of the chat bot. The following code shows the simplest way
to authorize only yourself as a user of the chatbot: you just write your chat id in env. variable,
and check that the user is legit.

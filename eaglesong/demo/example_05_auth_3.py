### Implementing chat flow as a class

The decomposition to functions is totally fine. But myself, I prefer the object-oriented way of encoding skills.
Here, we first create `Authorize` object. Then, we may do some fine-tuning of this object (sometimes
skills have lots of internal variables and it's unhandy to place all of them in constructor). And finally,
we use this object like a function in `yield from`.

Essentially, we write something like `yield from Authorize('KAIA_TEST_BOT_CHAT_ID')()`.
Those double brackets may seem weird, but this is totally fine thanks to `Authorize` class
implementing `__call__` method.
